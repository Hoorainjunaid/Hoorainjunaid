        <p> Our family is learning HTML and CSS together, making it a fun <br> and supportive journey. We started with the basics and are now creating small projects <br> like a family website and personal blogs. This experience has strengthened our teamwork, <br> and weâ€™re excited to keep improving our skills together!</p>
